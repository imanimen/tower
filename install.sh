# Why this exists: files fetched with curl are NOT flagged with
# com.apple.quarantine, so Gatekeeper never assesses them. A browser download of
# the same zip *is* flagged, and because Tower is only ad-hoc signed (not
# notarized — that needs a paid Apple Developer account), Gatekeeper blocks it
# with "unidentified developer". Installing via curl sidesteps that entirely:
# the app just opens.
#
# Everything lives inside main(), called on the last line, so a half-downloaded
# script executes nothing. No sudo, no interactive prompts (stdin is the pipe).
