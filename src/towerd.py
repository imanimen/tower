towerd — Tower core daemon (no web server, no shell alias).

One background process that:
  * runs a local HTTPS/HTTP proxy (the "fence") pinning Claude Code to a country,
  * polls public-IP location,
  * reads Claude Code's local transcripts for real usage + pace,
  * routes Claude by editing ~/.claude/settings.json env (NEVER the shell),
  * talks to its front-ends (Swift menubar + Python TUI) through plain files
    in ~/.tower/ : state.json (out) and cmd/<id>.json (in).

stdlib only. Single instance (flock). Proxy fixed on :8888 so settings stay stable.

#      every BLOCK_POLL_S) so a sub-second blip (geo re-confirming) clears and
#      the request succeeds on the FIRST try with no visible retry. This hold is
#      deliberately short: it happens BEFORE the CONNECT tunnel is established,
#      and Claude Code's TCP connect timeout for the proxy tunnel is undocumented
#      (~120s, possibly shorter) — a long pre-CONNECT hold risks tripping it and
#      making things worse. Keep it well under any plausible connect timeout.
#   2. 503 + retry — if still blocked, we answer 503 + Retry-After immediately.
#      Claude Code auto-retries 5xx with its native "Retrying in Ns · attempt
#      x/y" spinner. THAT is the durable "pending" UX: the agent waits and
#      resumes on its own when the guard clears. The retry budget is turned up
#      via settings.json env (see arm_retry_tolerance) so it rides out a whole
#      network switch instead of exhausting after the default 10 attempts.
# We reply 503, NEVER 403: Claude treats 403 as broken auth ("Please run
# /login") and kills the turn, but treats 503 as a transient, retry-able error.
