# Packaging uses `ditto -c -k --keepParent`, NOT `zip`: ditto preserves the
# bundle's execute bits and metadata. A zip made another way can land on a user's
# Mac as an app that won't launch.
#
# Note the app is only ad-hoc signed (build.sh), not notarized. That's why the
# *recommended* install path is the curl one-liner in site/install.sh:
# curl-downloaded files carry no quarantine flag,
# so Gatekeeper never shows the "unidentified developer" block. This zip stays
# published for people who'd rather download by hand (they get the Gatekeeper
# prompt, and the README tells them how to clear it).
#
# Requires: gh (authenticated — `gh auth login`).

\`\`\`sh
curl -fsSL https://ghhrmnzdh.github.io/tower/install.sh | sh
\`\`\`

Installs Tower to /Applications, puts the \`tower\` command on your PATH, and
launches it. **No Gatekeeper warning** — a curl-downloaded file is never
quarantined, so macOS doesn't assess it.

Menu bar: the radar appears at the top right.
Terminal dashboard: type \`tower\`, or click **Terminal Dashboard…** in the popover.

## Debian / Ubuntu

\`tower_all.deb\` below — the daemon, the terminal dashboard, and the radar for
your top bar, in one package (Ubuntu 22.04 → 26.04, amd64 and arm64).

\`\`\`sh
sudo apt install ./tower_all.deb
tower-tray
\`\`\`

It is attached by CI on the tag, so it may appear a few minutes after this
release does. Details and the full requirement list: [docs/LINUX.md](https://github.com/$REPO/blob/main/docs/LINUX.md).

### Downloading by hand instead?

Grab \`Tower.app.zip\` below — *not* \"Source code\", which contains no built app.
macOS quarantines browser downloads, and because this build isn't notarized it
will refuse to open it as *\"from an unidentified developer.\"* On macOS 15+,
right-click → Open no longer clears this. Either:

\`\`\`sh
xattr -rd com.apple.quarantine /Applications/Tower.app
\`\`\`

…or open it once and choose **Open Anyway** in System Settings → Privacy &
Security. The one-liner above avoids all of it.

Requires macOS 14+ on Apple Silicon, Python 3, and Claude Code."
